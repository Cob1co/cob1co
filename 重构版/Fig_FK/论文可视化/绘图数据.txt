With the increasing penetration of renewable energy, efficiently accommodating its fluctuating output and improving the overall economic efficiency and flexibility of power systems have become critical challenges. Focusing on a wind-solar-storage hybrid microgrid system with molten salt thermal storage, this paper proposes a hierarchical optimization and control strategy enhanced by neural network adaptation. The strategy innovatively integrates neural network adaptive mechanisms (NAS) into both the upper-layer multi-objective Sparrow Search Algorithm (NAS-SSA) and the lower-layer adaptive sliding mode controller (NAS-SMC), enabling dynamic adjustment of system parameters and intelligent optimization of control laws. The upper-layer optimization, based on hourly data, utilizes NAS-SSA to perform multi-objective day-ahead scheduling for energy storage charging/discharging, heat supply management, and grid connection power exchange, balancing economic efficiency, load smoothing, and renewable energy utilization. The lower-layer control, based on 15-minute data, employs NAS-SMC for real-time fine control of devices such as electric heaters, ensuring heat demand satisfaction and the priority consumption of renewable energy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed neural network-enhanced hierarchical optimization and control strategy significantly improves the comprehensive operational efficiency of the system, promotes renewable energy integration, and enhances grid flexibility.
